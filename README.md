# Group-7 Nao Prototype

* To test our final protoype, first, pull the repository by using <mark>git clone</mark>.

* Be sure to have the required libraries by checking <mark>requirements.txt</mark>.
* Be sure that you have Open AI credentials file in <mark>Group-7</mark> folder.
* Before the experiment, connect the redis server by below command *(we are assuming that you already have redis)*
```console
redis-server conf/redis/redis.conf
```
* To determine the test group, we defined a boolean variable **IS_EMPATHY** inside the prototype script. Before running the experiment, check if it is set for the desired group
* To start the experiment, run the **green_7_FINAL_PROTOTYPE.py** script.
